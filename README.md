# xtracty
a userscript to extract tweet/post data from Twitter/X to YAML for easy handling


Note: This code is written to support quick ingestion into my website, [danielsgriffin.com](https://danielsgriffin.com). In particularly, I save the YAML portion to a weblinks.yml file and use the liquid, and a weblinks.html in `_includes/` to provide a simple automatic template.


I principally use [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) in Brave for my userscripts.


Please do ask questions or offer suggestions!
